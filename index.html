                <h1>Why Altschool</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>My journey into tech started  a year ago in July, when I was offered admission to study full-stack engineering at ALX Africa. 
                    Prior to this event I felt 
                    I was not intelligent enough to embark on this career path. I felt inadquate because of the deteriorating state of the country's economy and the finacial rewards that comes alongside  from learning this tech skills propelled me into deciding to learn this tech skill.
                    I was not able to cope with the pace of learning at ALX Africa so I resorted to searching for indigneonous quality
                     tech schools that are beginner friendly and that was how a good friend of mine informed me about Altschool. 
                     The testimonies from graduating students  were overwhelming, which I could also relate with,  many of the graduates testified of not having any prior knowledge about programming but now are well skilled with updated knowledge that are in high demands around the world.
